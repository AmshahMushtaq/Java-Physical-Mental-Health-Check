If you know of anyone who is struggling with their mental health, here are some helpful ways to show you care:
- You can say:
    - "I'm here for you"
    - "You're not alone"
    - "You are worthy and deserving"
    - "You don't have to apologize for your mental illness"
    - "There is treatment available to you"
    - You can listen instead of offering your opinion
    - You can validate their experiences
    - You can help the individual look into treatment options
